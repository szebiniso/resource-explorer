## Side note

If I had more time, I would:
- Add search, sort, filter, and ‚Äúclear all‚Äù functionality for favorite items stored in localStorage.
- Improve the overall UI for a more polished and responsive experience.
- Implement breadcrumbs for better navigation.
- Complete full CRUD operations for the character data.
